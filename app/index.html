          <p><strong>#HackSuncoast is the Suncoast Community High School's Premier Hackathon where we aim to bring 11th and 12th grade students together to design, code, create, and hack an idea around healthcare and how they can better connect their communities to healthcare service providers.</strong></p>

          <p>No prior experience as far as hackathons, wireframing, or even coding is necessary. They will learn new coding practices, be introduced to new languages & development tools, as well as be connected to mentors from the industry who will help cultivate their desires to learn more about various coding practices and bring their solutions to a tangible state.</p>

          <p>This experience will allow them to see how enterprise developers and businesses come up with and create various applications and technological solutions that they implement within the business. This hands on experience will give them work in the real world of a programmer, and teach them concepts that they might not gain from a typical class lecture or assignment.</p>
